# Quince

## A simple, Git-friendly RDF repository

Quince is a file-based RDF repository. It stores RDF in a simple indexed directory structure that allows
for easy matching of triple patterns. Because Quince uses the line-oriented NQuads format for its data files,
it is also possible to use line-based diffs such as that provided by Git to tell what has changed in a
Quince store.

Quince is being used to manage the RDF data in (DataDock.io)[http://datadock.io/].

Quince is developed by (NetworkedPlanet)[http://networkedplanet.com/], specialists in Linked and Open Data.
